# Photo aspect ratio checker
Imagine you have a folder full of photos you are sending to be printed. Usually you print to 3:2 aspect ratio, but your phone or camera could use other aspect ratio. Then this is a tool for you!

* Clone the repo
* Install PIL library using `pip install pillow`
* run using python `aspect_ratio_checker.py "absolute_directory_path"`

The tool will print out name of the images with different then 3:2 aspect ratio.
